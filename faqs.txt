I wrote a critical thinking test on the 7th of December at JHB Campus. We were informed that weâll all receive our results/ feedback within a week, which is 7 days. Iâm anxious and clueless Because I havenât received anything from the School. 
I have sent numerous emails still no reply

Good evening! Wanted to confirm about the opening day on the 12th of this month? Is it really happening and if so, how do i access directions and all?





Dear wethinkcode 


I'm kheli I participated in the wethinkcode Bootcamp from the 12th to the 17th of April.


I just came to a realization that I may have made a mistake in the process of submitting my daily Edu flow exercises and assignments, I use the username Kheli020_hedy instead of the one I was given which is mndebele020. I just wanted to ask if that will somehow affect my grades seeing that I used my student email as well which is mndebele020@student.wethinkcode.co.za.Â 

The reason I used a different username is that it is the same one I used for my slack account and I didn't know if we were supposed to use the email one.


I'd like to hear back from you.


Yours sincerelyÂ 

Kheli





I would like to know if it possible to apply from The Gambia

Hello, how are you? My name is Joseph Marlon Mabeka, from Zimbabwe. Taking on the quiz posted on WTC instagram page and been able to solve the puzzles. Made meÂ  Â keen to enroll at WTC. I tried the online application unfortunately it requires a visa for non south african applicants. I don't have a South AfricanÂ  visa.


Â I visited the South African embassyÂ  in my country to enquire about the visa application. They require an acceptance letter from the school.(WTC).


I also understand that you can't not give me an acceptance letter, until have taken the application test and been successful in the bootcamp.


I'm wondering if I can come to South Africa and take the exam on campus?


Kind regards
